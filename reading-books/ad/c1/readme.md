###### 1.1 A First Problem: Stable Matching （稳定配配）

As an opening topic, we look at an algorithmic problem that nicely(很好) illustrates(说明) many of the themes we will be emphasizing(强调). It is motivated(有动力) by some very natural(自然) and practical(实际的) concerns(关注点), and from these we formulate(制定) a clean and simple statement(陈述) of a problem. The algorithm to solve(解决) the problem is very clean as well, and most of our work will be spent(花费) in proving(证明) that it is correct(正确的) and giving an acceptable(合适) bound on the amount(数量) of time it takes to terminate(使...结束) with an answer. The problem itself -- the Stable Matching Problem -- has several(数个、各自的) origins.
